## User Stories

I used Github projects board while working on this project to log my user stories so that I could break the project down into smaller tasks that would be more manageable by moving them into the in progress section whilst I focused on the task and into the done section once completed.

## Expectations

### First Time Users

- I want to be able to see the dates and times that the company offer walks.

- I want to be able to register an account so that I can make bookings through the site.

- I want to be able to create a profile with all the releven information my dog walker would need to know.

- I want to be able to request a booking so that the walkers know I'm interested in making a booking on that day/time.

### Returning User

- I want to be able to view my profile so that I can see my information is correct.

- I want to be able to edit my profile so that if I move address or have new info the walkers may need, I can change this on my profile.

- I want to be able to view my current bookings so that I can see when I have booked a walk for and if it has been approved.

- I want to be able to request to change my booking so that if my plans change I can change my walks too.

- I want to be able to Cancel a booking so that if I no longer need the walk I can let the walkers know.

### Admin

## Testing

### Responsive 

I use Am I Responsive to check if my site is responsive to all devices, I have not yet focused on this as I believe it is more important for me to focus on the functionality of the site first. 

### HTML

[W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to test the HTML for any errors.



### Python 

Python was tested using PEP8 [PEP8 validator](http://pep8online.com/)
